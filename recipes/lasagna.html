            <p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy; this lasagna made with</p>
            <p>spinach pasta cannot be beat. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests,</p>
            <p>or even yourself. It may be a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>For the pasta dough: Steam the spinach in a steamer or over boiling water</p>
                    <p>until bright green, 2 minutes. Squeeze to remove excess moisture and process</p>
                    <p>in a food processor to make a paste. Combine spinach with eggs, semolina, and</p>
                    <p>salt and process until smooth. Stir in enough of the flour to make a smooth dough.</p>
                    <p>Knead briefly, cover and set aside.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>For the ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Saute bacon,</p>
                    <p>carrot, celery and onion until onion is translucent. Stir in ground pork, ground</p>
                    <p>beef and minced ham, and cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste, oregano</p>
                    <p>and beef stock. (Reserve the chicken livers for later.) Season with salt and</p>
                    <p>pepper, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 20 minutes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>For the bechamel: While the ragu is simmering, combine 2 tablespoons butter</p>
                    <p>and 2 tablespoons flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to</p>
                    <p>make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest one minute, then whisk in warm milk.</p>
                    <p>Return to heat, simmer 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season</p>
                    <p>with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To cook pasta: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured</p>
                    <p>surface, divide pasta dough into three portions. Roll each portion out to a thin</p>
                    <p>sheet. Have ready an ice water bath. Cook each sheet 3 minutes in the boiling</p>
                    <p>water; remove from the boiling water and dip in the ice water; drain and dry on</p>
                    <p>a clean, dry cloth.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>To finish the ragu: Stir the chicken livers into the simmering sauce. Cook 1</p>
                    <p>minute, remove from heat and set aside.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 baking dish.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To assemble lasagna: Place one pasta sheet in bottom of prepared baking dish.</p>
                    <p>Spread one-third of the ragu, one-quarter of the bechamel, one-third of the</p>
                    <p>ricotta, and one-quarter of the parmesan over the pasta. Repeat layers twice.</p>
                    <p>Top with remaining bechamel and parmesan and dot with butter.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until top is golden brown.</p>
                </li>
